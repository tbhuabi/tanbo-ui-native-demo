If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {\\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better\n * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression\n * bound to the trigger changes.\n *\n * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the\n * {\\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element\n * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that\n * the\n * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\\@triggerName]=\"expression\"`.\n *\n * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against\n * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both\n * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values\n * respectively.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The\n * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} declarations.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *       state(...),\n *       state(...),\n *       transition(...),\n *       transition(...)\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ## Disable Animations\n * A special animation control binding called `\\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will\n * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as\n * any animations on the element itself.\n *\n * When true, the `\\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example\n * below shows how to use this feature:\n *\n * ```ts\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [\\@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n *       <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n *       // ...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   isDisabled = true;\n *   exp = '...';\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The `\\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\\@.disabled` prevents it from happening\n * (when true).\n *\n * Note that `\\@.disbled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on\n * the same element will also be disabled).\n *\n * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide\n * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will\n * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular\n * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular\n * component.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\\@angular/core';\n *\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'app-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n * })\n * class AppComponent {\n *   \\@HostBinding('\\@.disabled')\n *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?\n * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\\@link query query} for inner\n * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is\n * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\\@link\n * animateChild animateChild}.\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} name\n * @param {?} definitions\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction trigger(name, definitions) {\n    return { type: 7 /* Trigger */, name: name, definitions: definitions, options: {} };\n}\n/**\n * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given\n * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected\n * to be used within {\\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\\@link group group}, or {\\@link\n * transition transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay\n * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the\n * `duration` value in millisecond form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\\@link style style} or {\\@link\n * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected\n * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by\n * {\\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timings\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animate(timings, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    return { type: 4 /* Animate */, styles: styles, timings: timings };\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

Grouped animations are\n * useful when a series of styles must be animated/closed off at different starting/ending times.\n *\n * The `group` function can either be used within a {\\@link sequence sequence} or a {\\@link transition\n * transition} and it will only continue to the next instruction once all of the inner animation\n * steps have completed.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `steps` data that is passed into the `group` animation function can either consist of {\\@link\n * style style} or {\\@link animate animate} function calls. Each call to `style()` or `animate()`\n * within a group will be executed instantly (use {\\@link keyframes keyframes} or a {\\@link\n * animate#usage animate() with a delay value} to offset styles to be applied at a later time).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * group([\n *   animate(\"1s\", { background: \"black\" }))\n *   animate(\"2s\", { color: \"white\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} steps\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction group(steps, options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 3 /* Group */, steps: steps, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `sequence` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `state` declares an animation state within the given trigger. When a state is active within a\n * component then its associated styles will persist on the element that the trigger is attached to\n * (even when the animation ends).\n *\n * To animate between states, have a look at the animation {\\@link transition transition} DSL\n * function. To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\\@link trigger\n * trigger} function.\n *\n * #### The `void` state\n *\n * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not\n * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the\n * associated element is void).\n *\n * #### The `*` (default) state\n *\n * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being\n * animated is not declared within the trigger.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles\n * within the given trigger.\n *\n * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.\n * - `styles` refers to the {\\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once\n * the state has been reached.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // \"void\" is a reserved name for a state and is used to represent\n * // the state in which an element is detached from from the application.\n * state(\"void\", style({ height: 0 }))\n *\n * // user-defined states\n * state(\"closed\", style({ height: 0 }))\n * state(\"open, visible\", style({ height: \"*\" }))\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} name\n * @param {?} styles\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction state(name, styles, options) {\n    return { type: 0 /* State */, name: name, styles: styles, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `keyframes` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

Instead of applying animations from where they are currently to their\n * destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied and at what point within the\n * animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).\n *\n * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set.

If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `transition` declares the {\\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the\n * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>\n * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting\n * and/or ending state).\n *\n * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this\n * function will be executed each time a state change occurs.

For an transition\n * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\\@link state animation\n * states} is expected to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition\n * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be\n * triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n *\n *   // you can also go full out and include a function\n *   transition((fromState, toState) => {\n *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked\n *     return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *   }, animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a\n * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc\n * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using :enter and :leave\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ]),\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Boolean values\n * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition\n * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.\n *\n * ```\n * // in the template\n * <div [\\@openClose]=\"open ? true : false\">...</div>\n *\n * // in the component metadata\n * trigger('openClose', [\n *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),\n *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),\n *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using :increment and :decrement\n * In addition to the :enter and :leave transition aliases, the :increment and :decrement aliases\n * can be used to kick off a transition when a numeric value has increased or decreased in value.\n *\n * ```\n * import {group, animate, query, transition, style, trigger} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * import {Component} from '\\@angular/core';\n *\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'banner-carousel-component',\n *   styles: [`\n *     .banner-container {\n *        position:relative;\n *        height:500px;\n *        overflow:hidden;\n *      }\n *     .banner-container > .banner {\n *        position:absolute;\n *        left:0;\n *        top:0;\n *        font-size:200px;\n *        line-height:500px;\n *        font-weight:bold;\n *        text-align:center;\n *        width:100%;\n *      }\n *   `],\n *   template: `\n *     <button (click)=\"previous()\">Previous</button>\n *     <button (click)=\"next()\">Next</button>\n *     <hr>\n *     <div [\\@bannerAnimation]=\"selectedIndex\" class=\"banner-container\">\n *       <div class=\"banner\"> {{ banner }} </div>\n *     </div>\n *   `\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('bannerAnimation', [\n *       transition(\":increment\", group([\n *         query(':enter', [\n *           style({ left: '100%' }),\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *         ]),\n *         query(':leave', [\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))\n *         ])\n *       ])),\n *       transition(\":decrement\", group([\n *         query(':enter', [\n *           style({ left: '-100%' }),\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *         ]),\n *         query(':leave', [\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '100%' }))\n *         ])\n *       ])),\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class BannerCarouselComponent {\n *   allBanners: string[] = ['1', '2', '3', '4'];\n *   selectedIndex: number = 0;\n *\n *   get banners() {\n *      return [this.allBanners[this.selectedIndex]];\n *   }\n *\n *   previous() {\n *     this.selectedIndex = Math.max(this.selectedIndex - 1, 0);\n *   }\n *\n *   next() {\n *     this.selectedIndex = Math.min(this.selectedIndex + 1, this.allBanners.length - 1);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps, options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `animation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.\n *\n * `var myAnimation = animation(...)` is designed to produce a reusable animation that can be later\n * invoked in another animation or sequence.

It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own\n * animation within the animation sequence.\n *\n * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation\n * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order\n * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements\n * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.\n *\n * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation\n * triggers that will execute at the same time.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"exp =! exp\">Toggle</button>\n * <hr>\n *\n * <div [\\@parentAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *   <header>Hello</header>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       one\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       two\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       three\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate\n * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations\n * can also fire:\n *\n * ```ts\n * // parent-child.component.ts\n * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'parent-child-component',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('parentAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         query('header', [\n *           style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *         ]),\n *         query('\\@childAnimation', [\n *           animateChild()\n *         ])\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     trigger('childAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ParentChildCmp {\n *   exp: boolean = false;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to\n * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the\n * `\\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.\n *\n * This example can be further extended by using stagger:\n *\n * ```ts\n * query('\\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [\n *   animateChild()\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.\n *\n * ## The first frame of child animations\n * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the\n * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way\n * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the\n * sub animations kick off.\n *\n * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition\n * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`\n * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\\@childAnimation` is queried and called\n * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.\n *\n * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\\@link query query()} and it will only work\n * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes\n * and transitions are not handled by this API).\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animateChild(options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 9 /* AnimateChild */, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `useAnimation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

You do\n * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.\n *\n * ### How to use select controls with form directives\n *\n * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`\n * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.\n *\n * If your option values are simple strings, you can bind to the normal `value` property\n * on the option.  If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Caveat: Option selection\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n *\n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n *\n * #### Syntax\n *\n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n *\n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"_39\" /* ɵlooseIdentical */];\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n        if (id == null) {\n            this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n        }\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n        this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = _this._getOptionValue(valueString);\n            fn(_this.value);\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /** @internal */\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /** @internal */\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (this._compareWith(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /** @internal */\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n * }, passwordMatchValidator);\n *\n *\n * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {\n *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value\n *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Like {\\@link FormControl} instances, you can alternatively choose to pass in\n * validators and async validators as part of an options object.\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   password: new FormControl('')\n *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')\n * }, {validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator});\n * ```\n *\n * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child\n * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the\n * group level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child\n * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const c = new FormGroup({\n *    one: new FormControl()\n * }, {updateOn: 'blur'});\n * ```\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar FormGroup = (function (_super) {\n    Object(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0_tslib__[\"b\" /* __extends */])(FormGroup, _super);\n    function FormGroup(controls, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, coerceToValidator(validatorOrOpts), coerceToAsyncValidator(asyncValidator, validatorOrOpts)) || this;\n        _this.controls = controls;\n        _this._initObservables();\n        _this._setUpdateStrategy(validatorOrOpts);\n        _this._setUpControls();\n        _this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n     *\n     * This method does not update the value or validity of the control, so for most cases you'll want\n     * to use {@link FormGroup#addControl addControl} instead.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n     *\n     * This method does not update the value or validity of the control, so for most cases you'll want\n     * to use {\\@link FormGroup#addControl addControl} instead.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.registerControl = /**\n     * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n     *\n     * This method does not update the value or validity of the control, so for most cases you'll want\n     * to use {\\@link FormGroup#addControl addControl} instead.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            return this.controls[name];\n        this.controls[name] = control;\n        control.setParent(this);\n        control._registerOnCollectionChange(this._onCollectionChange);\n        return control;\n    };\n    /**\n     * Add a control to this group.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Add a control to this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.addControl = /**\n     * Add a control to this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name, control) {\n        this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Remove a control from this group.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Remove a control from this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.removeControl = /**\n     * Remove a control from this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.setControl = /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        if (control)\n            this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Check whether there is an enabled control with the given name in the group.\n     *\n     * It will return false for disabled controls.

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormGroup}.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n *\n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include array-level validators and async validators. These come in handy\n * when you want to perform validation that considers the value of more than one child\n * control.\n *\n * The two types of validators can be passed in separately as the second and third arg\n * respectively, or together as part of an options object.\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy'),\n *   new FormControl('Drew')\n * ], {validators: myValidator, asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator});\n * ```\n *\n * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child\n * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the\n * array level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child\n * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const c = new FormArray([\n *    new FormControl()\n * ], {updateOn: 'blur'});\n * ```\n *\n * ### Adding or removing controls\n *\n * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods\n * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the\n * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate\n * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such\n * as broken change detection.\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar FormArray = (function (_super) {\n    Object(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0_tslib__[\"b\" /* __extends */])(FormArray, _super);\n    function FormArray(controls, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, coerceToValidator(validatorOrOpts), coerceToAsyncValidator(asyncValidator, validatorOrOpts)) || this;\n        _this.controls = controls;\n        _this._initObservables();\n        _this._setUpdateStrategy(validatorOrOpts);\n        _this._setUpControls();\n        _this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Get the {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Get the {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.at = /**\n     * Get the {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index) { return this.controls[index]; };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.push = /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (control) {\n        this.controls.push(control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.insert = /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index, control) {\n        this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.removeAt = /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.setControl = /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index, control) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n        if (control) {\n            this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n            this._registerControl(control);\n        }\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArray.prototype, \"length\", {\n        /**\n         * Length of the control array.\n         */\n        get: /**\n         * Length of the control array.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () { return this.controls.length; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     *  Sets the value of the {@link FormArray}.

You don't need to add a special selector.\n *\n * You can export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key\n * (ex: `#myForm=\"ngForm\"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying\n * {\\@link FormGroup} instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it\n * will give you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as\n * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.\n *\n * To register child controls with the form, you'll want to use {\\@link NgModel} with a\n * `name` attribute.  You can also use {\\@link NgModelGroup} if you'd like to create\n * sub-groups within the form.\n *\n * You can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has\n * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event will be emitted with the original form\n * submission event.\n *\n * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.\n * If you want to import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,\n * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, you can add `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`\n * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is\n * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would\n * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgForm = (function (_super) {\n    Object(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0_tslib__[\"b\" /* __extends */])(NgForm, _super);\n    function NgForm(validators, asyncValidators) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this.submitted = false;\n        _this._directives = [];\n        _this.ngSubmit = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"u\" /* EventEmitter */]();\n        _this.form =\n            new FormGroup({}, composeValidators(validators), composeAsyncValidators(asyncValidators));\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgForm.prototype.ngAfterViewInit = /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () { this._setUpdateStrategy();

All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    Object(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0_tslib__[\"b\" /* __extends */])(NgModel, _super);\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this.control = new FormControl();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        _this._registered = false;\n        _this.update = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"u\" /* EventEmitter */]();\n        _this._parent = parent;\n        _this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        _this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        _this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(_this, valueAccessors);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this);

See a full list of available properties in\n * {\\@link AbstractControl}.\n *\n * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the {\\@link FormControl},\n * or you can set it programmatically later using {\\@link AbstractControl#setValue setValue} or\n * {\\@link AbstractControl#patchValue patchValue}.\n *\n * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can\n * subscribe to the {\\@link AbstractControl#valueChanges valueChanges} event.

You can also listen to\n * {\\@link AbstractControl#statusChanges statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is\n * re-calculated.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * In this example, we create form controls for first name and last name.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleFormGroup/simple_form_group_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `formControlName` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: {\\@link ReactiveFormsModule}\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar FormControlName = (function (_super) {\n    Object(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0_tslib__[\"b\" /* __extends */])(FormControlName, _super);\n    function FormControlName(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this._added = false;\n        _this.update = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__angular_core__[\"u\" /* EventEmitter */]();\n        _this._parent = parent;\n        _this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        _this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        _this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(_this, valueAccessors);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"isDisabled\", {\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} isDisabled\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (isDisabled) { ReactiveErrors.disabledAttrWarning(); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormControlName.prototype.ngOnChanges = /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (changes) {\n        if (!this._added)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n            this.formDirective.updateModel(this, this.model);\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormControlName.prototype.ngOnDestroy = /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () {\n        if (this.formDirective) {\n            this.formDirective.removeControl(this);\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} newValue\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormControlName.prototype.viewToModelUpdate = /**\n     * @param {?} newValue\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (newValue) {\n        this.viewModel = newValue;\n        this.update.emit(newValue);\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"path\", {\n        get: /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () { return controlPath(this.name, /** @type {?} */ ((this._parent))); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"formDirective\", {\n        get: /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () { return this._parent ?

app.module.ts 入口模块\\n\\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\\nimport { UIComponentsModule, UIDirectivesModule, UIFormsModule } from 'tanbo-ui-native';\\n\\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\\n\\n@NgModule({\\n    imports: [\\n        UIComponentsModule.forRoot(), // 如果是异步模块，如路由模块，请调用 `forChild()` 方法\\n        UIDirectivesModule,\\n        UIFormsModule, // UIFormsModule 一定要写在 FormsModule 之前，否则会导致部分校验指令不能正常工作\\n        BrowserModule,\\n        FormsModule\\n    ],\\n    declarations: [\\n        AppComponent\\n    ],\\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\\n})\\n\\nexport class AppModule {\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```typescript\\n// # app.component.ts 根组件\\n\\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\\n\\n@Component({\\n    selector: '<my-app></my-app>',\\n    template: '<ui-app></ui-app>'\\n})\\nexport class AppComponent {\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n### 在项目中导入 tanbo-ui-native 的样式表\\n\\ntanbo-ui-native 的样式表采用 sass 开发，你可以导入 sass 源文件，进行定制化开发，也可以直接导入已编译好的 css 文件。\\n\\n在 ts 文件中导入编译好的 css 文件\\n```typescript\\n// # main.ts\\n// 按照 angular 项目的约定，在 main.ts 里导入全局样式表\\nimport 'tanbo-ui-native/bundles/tanbo-ui-native.min.css';\\n```\\n\\n在 global.scss 中导入 scss 源文件和字体 css 文件，然后导入 global.scss 到 main.ts\\n```scss\\n// # global.scss\\n@import \\\"~tanbo-ui-native/bundles/assets/scss/varibles\\\";\\n@import \\\"~tanbo-ui-native/bundles/assets/scss/custom-index\\\";\\n@import \\\"~tanbo-ui-native/bundles/assets/fonts/style.css\\\";\\n```\\n```typescript\\n// #

If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {\\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better\n * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression\n * bound to the trigger changes.\n *\n * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the\n * {\\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element\n * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that\n * the\n * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\\@triggerName]=\"expression\"`.\n *\n * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against\n * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both\n * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values\n * respectively.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The\n * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} declarations.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *       state(...),\n *       state(...),\n *       transition(...),\n *       transition(...)\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ## Disable Animations\n * A special animation control binding called `\\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will\n * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as\n * any animations on the element itself.\n *\n * When true, the `\\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example\n * below shows how to use this feature:\n *\n * ```ts\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [\\@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n *       <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n *       // ...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   isDisabled = true;\n *   exp = '...';\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The `\\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\\@.disabled` prevents it from happening\n * (when true).\n *\n * Note that `\\@.disbled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on\n * the same element will also be disabled).\n *\n * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide\n * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will\n * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular\n * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular\n * component.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\\@angular/core';\n *\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'app-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n * })\n * class AppComponent {\n *   \\@HostBinding('\\@.disabled')\n *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?\n * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\\@link query query} for inner\n * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is\n * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\\@link\n * animateChild animateChild}.\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} name\n * @param {?} definitions\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction trigger(name, definitions) {\n    return { type: 7 /* Trigger */, name: name, definitions: definitions, options: {} };\n}\n/**\n * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given\n * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value. Calls to `animate` are expected\n * to be used within {\\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\\@link group group}, or {\\@link\n * transition transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay\n * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the\n * `duration` value in millisecond form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\\@link style style} or {\\@link\n * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected\n * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by\n * {\\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timings\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animate(timings, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    return { type: 4 /* Animate */, styles: styles, timings: timings };\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `transition` declares the {\\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the\n * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>\n * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting\n * and/or ending state).\n *\n * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this\n * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the\n * function is true then the associated animation will be run.\n *\n * Animation transitions are placed within an {\\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition\n * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\\@link state animation\n * states} is expected to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition\n * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be\n * triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n *\n *   // you can also go full out and include a function\n *   transition((fromState, toState) => {\n *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked\n *     return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *   }, animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a\n * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc\n * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using :enter and :leave\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ]),\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Boolean values\n * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition\n * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.\n *\n * ```\n * // in the template\n * <div [\\@openClose]=\"open ? true : false\">...</div>\n *\n * // in the component metadata\n * trigger('openClose', [\n *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),\n *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),\n *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using :increment and :decrement\n * In addition to the :enter and :leave transition aliases, the :increment and :decrement aliases\n * can be used to kick off a transition when a numeric value has increased or decreased in value.\n *\n * ```\n * import {group, animate, query, transition, style, trigger} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * import {Component} from '\\@angular/core';\n *\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'banner-carousel-component',\n *   styles: [`\n *     .banner-container {\n *        position:relative;\n *        height:500px;\n *        overflow:hidden;\n *      }\n *     .banner-container > .banner {\n *        position:absolute;\n *        left:0;\n *        top:0;\n *        font-size:200px;\n *        line-height:500px;\n *        font-weight:bold;\n *        text-align:center;\n *        width:100%;\n *      }\n *   `],\n *   template: `\n *     <button (click)=\"previous()\">Previous</button>\n *     <button (click)=\"next()\">Next</button>\n *     <hr>\n *     <div [\\@bannerAnimation]=\"selectedIndex\" class=\"banner-container\">\n *       <div class=\"banner\"> {{ banner }} </div>\n *     </div>\n *   `\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('bannerAnimation', [\n *       transition(\":increment\", group([\n *         query(':enter', [\n *           style({ left: '100%' }),\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *         ]),\n *         query(':leave', [\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))\n *         ])\n *       ])),\n *       transition(\":decrement\", group([\n *         query(':enter', [\n *           style({ left: '-100%' }),\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *         ]),\n *         query(':leave', [\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '100%' }))\n *         ])\n *       ])),\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class BannerCarouselComponent {\n *   allBanners: string[] = ['1', '2', '3', '4'];\n *   selectedIndex: number = 0;\n *\n *   get banners() {\n *      return [this.allBanners[this.selectedIndex]];\n *   }\n *\n *   previous() {\n *     this.selectedIndex = Math.max(this.selectedIndex - 1, 0);\n *   }\n *\n *   next() {\n *     this.selectedIndex = Math.min(this.selectedIndex + 1, this.allBanners.length - 1);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps, options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `animation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.\n *\n * `var myAnimation = animation(...)` is designed to produce a reusable animation that can be later\n * invoked in another animation or sequence.

It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own\n * animation within the animation sequence.\n *\n * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation\n * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order\n * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements\n * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.\n *\n * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation\n * triggers that will execute at the same time.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"exp =! exp\">Toggle</button>\n * <hr>\n *\n * <div [\\@parentAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *   <header>Hello</header>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       one\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       two\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       three\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate\n * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations\n * can also fire:\n *\n * ```ts\n * // parent-child.component.ts\n * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'parent-child-component',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('parentAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         query('header', [\n *           style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *         ]),\n *         query('\\@childAnimation', [\n *           animateChild()\n *         ])\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     trigger('childAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ParentChildCmp {\n *   exp: boolean = false;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to\n * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the\n * `\\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.\n *\n * This example can be further extended by using stagger:\n *\n * ```ts\n * query('\\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [\n *   animateChild()\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.\n *\n * ## The first frame of child animations\n * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the\n * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way\n * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the\n * sub animations kick off.\n *\n * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition\n * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`\n * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\\@childAnimation` is queried and called\n * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.\n *\n * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\\@link query query()} and it will only work\n * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes\n * and transitions are not handled by this API).\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animateChild(options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 9 /* AnimateChild */, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * `useAnimation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

You do\n * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.\n *\n * ### How to use select controls with form directives\n *\n * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`\n * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.\n *\n * If your option values are simple strings, you can bind to the normal `value` property\n * on the option.  If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Caveat: Option selection\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n *\n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n *\n * #### Syntax\n *\n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n *\n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n        if (id == null) {\n            this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n        }\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n        this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = _this._getOptionValue(valueString);\n            fn(_this.value);\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /** @internal */\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /** @internal */\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (this._compareWith(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /** @internal */\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n *\n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select multiple>` supports `compareWith`\n * input. `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects options by the return value of the function.\n *\n * #### Syntax\n *\n * ```\n * <select multiple [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n *\n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    function SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        set: /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (value) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ optionSelectedStateSetter;\n        if (Array.isArray(value)) {\n            // convert values to ids\n            var /** @type {?} */ ids_1 = value.map(function (v) { return _this._getOptionId(v);

Example:\n *\n * ```ts\n * const ctrl = new FormControl('some value');\n * console.log(ctrl.value);     // 'some value'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also initialize the control with a form state object on instantiation,\n * which includes both the value and whether or not the control is disabled.\n * You can't use the value key without the disabled key; both are required\n * to use this way of initialization.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const ctrl = new FormControl({value: 'n/a', disabled: true});\n * console.log(ctrl.value);     // 'n/a'\n * console.log(ctrl.status);   // 'DISABLED'\n * ```\n *\n * The second {\\@link FormControl} argument can accept one of three things:\n * * a sync validator function\n * * an array of sync validator functions\n * * an options object containing validator and/or async validator functions\n *\n * Example of a single sync validator function:\n *\n * ```ts\n * const ctrl = new FormControl('', Validators.required);\n * console.log(ctrl.value);     // ''\n * console.log(ctrl.status);   // 'INVALID'\n * ```\n *\n * Example using options object:\n *\n * ```ts\n * const ctrl = new FormControl('', {\n *    validators: Validators.required,\n *    asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * The options object can also be used to define when the control should update.\n * By default, the value and validity of a control updates whenever the value\n * changes. You can configure it to update on the blur event instead by setting\n * the `updateOn` option to `'blur'`.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const c = new FormControl('', { updateOn: 'blur' });\n * ```\n *\n * You can also set `updateOn` to `'submit'`, which will delay value and validity\n * updates until the parent form of the control fires a submit event.\n *\n * See its superclass, {\\@link AbstractControl}, for more properties and methods.\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar FormControl = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormControl, _super);\n    function FormControl(formState, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator) {\n        if (formState === void 0) { formState = null; }\n        var _this = _super.call(this, coerceToValidator(validatorOrOpts), coerceToAsyncValidator(asyncValidator, validatorOrOpts)) || this;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        _this._onChange = [];\n        _this._applyFormState(formState);\n        _this._setUpdateStrategy(validatorOrOpts);\n        _this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n        _this._initObservables();\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Set the value of the form control to `value`.\n     *\n     * If `onlySelf` is `true`, this change will only affect the validation of this `FormControl`\n     * and not its parent component.

It calculates its status by reducing the statuses\n * of its children. For example, if one of the controls in a group is invalid, the entire\n * group becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormGroup` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormArray}.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormGroup}, pass in a collection of child controls as the first\n * argument. The key for each child will be the name under which it is registered.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   first: new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   last: new FormControl('Drew'),\n * });\n *\n * console.log(form.value);   // {first: 'Nancy', last; 'Drew'}\n * console.log(form.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include group-level validators as the second arg, or group-level async\n * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n * }, passwordMatchValidator);\n *\n *\n * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {\n *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value\n *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Like {\\@link FormControl} instances, you can alternatively choose to pass in\n * validators and async validators as part of an options object.\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   password: new FormControl('')\n *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('')\n * }, {validators: passwordMatchValidator, asyncValidators: otherValidator});\n * ```\n *\n * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child\n * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the\n * group level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child\n * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const c = new FormGroup({\n *    one: new FormControl()\n * }, {updateOn: 'blur'});\n * ```\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar FormGroup = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormGroup, _super);\n    function FormGroup(controls, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, coerceToValidator(validatorOrOpts), coerceToAsyncValidator(asyncValidator, validatorOrOpts)) || this;\n        _this.controls = controls;\n        _this._initObservables();\n        _this._setUpdateStrategy(validatorOrOpts);\n        _this._setUpControls();\n        _this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n     *\n     * This method does not update the value or validity of the control, so for most cases you'll want\n     * to use {@link FormGroup#addControl addControl} instead.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n     *\n     * This method does not update the value or validity of the control, so for most cases you'll want\n     * to use {\\@link FormGroup#addControl addControl} instead.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.registerControl = /**\n     * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n     *\n     * This method does not update the value or validity of the control, so for most cases you'll want\n     * to use {\\@link FormGroup#addControl addControl} instead.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            return this.controls[name];\n        this.controls[name] = control;\n        control.setParent(this);\n        control._registerOnCollectionChange(this._onCollectionChange);\n        return control;\n    };\n    /**\n     * Add a control to this group.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Add a control to this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.addControl = /**\n     * Add a control to this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name, control) {\n        this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Remove a control from this group.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Remove a control from this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.removeControl = /**\n     * Remove a control from this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.setControl = /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        if (control)\n            this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Check whether there is an enabled control with the given name in the group.\n     *\n     * It will return false for disabled controls.

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormGroup}.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n *\n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include array-level validators and async validators. These come in handy\n * when you want to perform validation that considers the value of more than one child\n * control.\n *\n * The two types of validators can be passed in separately as the second and third arg\n * respectively, or together as part of an options object.\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy'),\n *   new FormControl('Drew')\n * ], {validators: myValidator, asyncValidators: myAsyncValidator});\n * ```\n *\n * The options object can also be used to set a default value for each child\n * control's `updateOn` property. If you set `updateOn` to `'blur'` at the\n * array level, all child controls will default to 'blur', unless the child\n * has explicitly specified a different `updateOn` value.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const c = new FormArray([\n *    new FormControl()\n * ], {updateOn: 'blur'});\n * ```\n *\n * ### Adding or removing controls\n *\n * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods\n * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the\n * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate\n * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such\n * as broken change detection.\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar FormArray = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormArray, _super);\n    function FormArray(controls, validatorOrOpts, asyncValidator) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, coerceToValidator(validatorOrOpts), coerceToAsyncValidator(asyncValidator, validatorOrOpts)) || this;\n        _this.controls = controls;\n        _this._initObservables();\n        _this._setUpdateStrategy(validatorOrOpts);\n        _this._setUpControls();\n        _this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * Get the {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Get the {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.at = /**\n     * Get the {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index) { return this.controls[index]; };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.push = /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (control) {\n        this.controls.push(control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.insert = /**\n     * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index, control) {\n        this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.removeAt = /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     */\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.setControl = /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} index\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (index, control) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n        if (control) {\n            this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n            this._registerControl(control);\n        }\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArray.prototype, \"length\", {\n        /**\n         * Length of the control array.\n         */\n        get: /**\n         * Length of the control array.\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () { return this.controls.length; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     *  Sets the value of the {@link FormArray}.

You don't need to add a special selector.\n *\n * You can export the directive into a local template variable using `ngForm` as the key\n * (ex: `#myForm=\"ngForm\"`). This is optional, but useful.  Many properties from the underlying\n * {\\@link FormGroup} instance are duplicated on the directive itself, so a reference to it\n * will give you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, as well as\n * user interaction properties like `dirty` and `touched`.\n *\n * To register child controls with the form, you'll want to use {\\@link NgModel} with a\n * `name` attribute.  You can also use {\\@link NgModelGroup} if you'd like to create\n * sub-groups within the form.\n *\n * You can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has\n * triggered a form submission. The `ngSubmit` event will be emitted with the original form\n * submission event.\n *\n * In template driven forms, all `<form>` tags are automatically tagged as `NgForm`.\n * If you want to import the `FormsModule` but skip its usage in some forms,\n * for example, to use native HTML5 validation, you can add `ngNoForm` and the `<form>`\n * tags won't create an `NgForm` directive. In reactive forms, using `ngNoForm` is\n * unnecessary because the `<form>` tags are inert. In that case, you would\n * refrain from using the `formGroup` directive.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgForm = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgForm, _super);\n    function NgForm(validators, asyncValidators) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this.submitted = false;\n        _this._directives = [];\n        _this.ngSubmit = new EventEmitter();\n        _this.form =\n            new FormGroup({}, composeValidators(validators), composeAsyncValidators(asyncValidators));\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgForm.prototype.ngAfterViewInit = /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () { this._setUpdateStrategy();

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        _this.control = new FormControl();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        _this._registered = false;\n        _this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        _this._parent = parent;\n        _this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        _this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        _this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(_this, valueAccessors);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        get: /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        function () {\n            return this._parent ?

app.module.ts 入口模块\\n\\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\\nimport { UIComponentsModule, UIDirectivesModule, UIFormsModule } from 'tanbo-ui-native';\\n\\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\\n\\n@NgModule({\\n    imports: [\\n        UIComponentsModule.forRoot(), // 如果是异步模块，如路由模块，请调用 `forChild()` 方法\\n        UIDirectivesModule,\\n        UIFormsModule, // UIFormsModule 一定要写在 FormsModule 之前，否则会导致部分校验指令不能正常工作\\n        BrowserModule,\\n        FormsModule\\n    ],\\n    declarations: [\\n        AppComponent\\n    ],\\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent]\\n})\\n\\nexport class AppModule {\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```typescript\\n// # app.component.ts 根组件\\n\\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\\n\\n@Component({\\n    selector: '<my-app></my-app>',\\n    template: '<ui-app></ui-app>'\\n})\\nexport class AppComponent {\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n### 在项目中导入 tanbo-ui-native 的样式表\\n\\ntanbo-ui-native 的样式表采用 sass 开发，你可以导入 sass 源文件，进行定制化开发，也可以直接导入已编译好的 css 文件。\\n\\n在 ts 文件中导入编译好的 css 文件\\n```typescript\\n// #
